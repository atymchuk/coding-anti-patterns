The purpose for this project is to serve as basis for a discussion during our front-end candidate interviews.

Potentially, there are some anti-patterns used in this solution. The challenge for the candidate is to:
* be able to identify the anti-patterns
* discuss the reasons why one would have to avoid them
* suggest possible ways to refactor the app to get rid of the anti-patterns
